# AWS-Practice-Website
A website built on AWS designed for me to learn and practice my cloud and python skills.

My name is Cody Hall. I'm currently a Security Engineer and I'm currently learning AWS and Python. This repo will contain the Python code that I am running on various AWS services to learn how to architect cloud solutions and become a skilled programmer.

This is the first architecture of my Python website, using traditional EC2 instances as a means to host it:

I am going to continue improving the quality of the website itself over time, and will soon be transitioning into a serverless architecture for my next challenge.
