# AWS-Practice-Website
A website built on AWS designed for me to learn and practice my cloud and python skills.

My name is Cody Hall. I'm currently a Senior Security Analyst and I'm currently working hard towards learning AWS and Python with the full intention of becoming a Cloud Engineer. This repo will contain the Python code that I am running on various AWS services to learn how to architect cloud solutions and become a skilled programmer.
